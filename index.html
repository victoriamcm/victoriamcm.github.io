<div id="left"><h2>What is Mov</h2>
<p>
Mov brings your favorite movies to life. Our app is designed to fully immerse you in a virtual reality based on our selection of movie posters. Using the camera on your phone, mov recognizes your mov poster and generates a reality for you to explore and share with on social media. You can also use Mov on any specially marked movie posters at movie theaters.

<div id="right"><h2>What's the Point?</h2>
<p>
Virtual Reality (VR) has become a very interesting way people experience our entertainment. With the rise in VR video games, the next step is our movies. The first step towards completely VR movies is their posters. How can we make movie posters embrace the technology we have at our fingertips? We could make them completely immersive, the similar to the way talented cinematographers get you to connect with their films. Giving the viewers a new way to experience film and advertising.

<div id="left"><h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>
Based on the poster Mov has recognized the app projects an environment based on that movie to your phone. The Environment is 360° so the experience is very similar to a watching a 360° video. By moving around your phone you can explore parts of that environment.

<div id="right"><h2>Do I Need a VR Headset?</h2>
<p>
No, it works great on your mobile devices, as well as on your desktops. Although I would recommend getting a VR headset or making your own. We have provided some resources for VR headsets.
